## Development

If you would like to contribute code to Platform Android you can do so by [forking](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) the [repository][1] and sending a pull request. We will review your code. If everything with the pull request looks good, we will humbly merge your changes.

### Branch structure

The repository is made up of two main branches: **master (stable)** and **release (quite stable and a temporary branch)**.

* **master** has the most tested latest code, it's tags are released as [Ushahidi Android][1] on the Google playstore.
* **release** is a branch of `master` after feature freeze. Mainly for fine tuning and testing to get the code stable for a release. The changes made here are finally merged into master branch. After which a version tag is created for a release.

Always, branch off the `master` branch. Typically something in this syntax. issue-number-fix-title. Eg. `24-fix-broken-message-filter`
