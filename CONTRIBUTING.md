## Development

If you would like to contribute code to Platform Android you can do so by forking the [repository][1] and sending a pull request. We will review your code. If everything with the pull request looks good, we will humbly merge your changes.

### Branch structure

The repository is made up of three main branches: **master (stable)**, **develop (ustable)** and **release (quite stable and a temporary branch)**.

* **master** has the latest stable code, it's tags are released on the Google playstore.
* **develop** has the latest unstable code. It's codes are merge into master.
* **release** is a branch of develop after feature freeze. Mainly for fine tuning and testing to get the code stable for a release. The changes made here are finally merged into develop then develop is merged into master branch. After which a version tag is created for a release.

Always, work with the `develop` branch.

Join the [developer mailing list][1] and let us hear what you're working on.

### Alpha & Beta Program.
This allows you to get updates as we make releases to our Alpha & Beta channels. These releases are not production ready.
We release them for the sole purposes to solicit feedback and dog fooding. If you're not interested in coding or not a developer and
want to help in testing, you can opt-in as a tester to help us fix bugs and fine tune the app for production releases. You
can read more on how to get started on the [Alpha & Beta forum][6].

Thanks for your support.
